			<h1>Understanding Web Frameworks</h1>
				<p>By Franco Andaya</p>
		<article>
			<p>
				A <strong>web framework</strong> (WF) <strong>or web application framework</strong> (WAF) is a software framework designed to support the development of web applications, including web services, web resources, and web APIs. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Web frameworks provide a standard way to build and deploy web applications on the World Wide Web. They aim to automate the overhead associated with common activities performed in web development, such as database access, templating, and session management.
			</p>
		<h3>Types of Web Frameworks</h3>
			<p>
				Web frameworks can be broadly categorized into <strong>frontend</strong> and <strong>backend</strong> frameworks.
			</p>
		<h3>Frontend Frameworks</h3>
			<p>
				Frontend frameworks are used to create the user interface of the website that users interact with. They are typically written in JavaScript and are responsible for the functionality and interactivity of the website.
			</p>
			<p>
				Some popular frontend frameworks include:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Angular</strong>: An open-source TypeScript-based framework created and maintained by Google. It is used for developing websites and Progressive Web Apps (PWAs).
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Vue.js</strong>: An open-source JavaScript-based framework that supports Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture. It is easy to learn and has large community support.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>React</strong>: Built by Facebook, React organizes frontend code into components, making it reusable and maintainable.
				</li>
			</ul>
		<h3>Backend Frameworks</h3>
			<p>
				Backend frameworks are used on the server side of the application. They handle requests, databases, and communication with APIs.
			</p>
			<p>
				Some popular backend frameworks include:
			</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Django</strong>: An open-source Python-based framework that provides a speedy development of web applications. It is based on Model Template View (MTV) architecture.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Ruby on Rails</strong>: An open-source Ruby-based framework that follows the Model View Controller (MVC) architecture. It is known for its scalability and security
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Spring Boot</strong>: An open-source Java-based framework that enables developers to develop production-ready and standalone applications
			</li>
		</ul>
